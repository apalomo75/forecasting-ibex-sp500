    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyses the IBEX-35 and the S&P500 using daily data to understand how both markets behave in terms of volatility, downside risk, drawdowns and forecasting stability. To do this, I have applied ARIMA, Prophet, EGARCH, Value-at-Risk and rolling correlations, allowing each index to be evaluated from multiple quantitative angles. The main objective is to compare their overall stability, their sensitivity to negative shocks and their ability to produce reliable forecasts. In short, both markets are put through the same structured pipeline to reveal which one behaves more consistently over time and which one carries greater risk when conditions deteriorate.\n"

    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses daily closing prices for both the IBEX-35 and the S&P500, covering the same time period. This ensures that -in every comparison, both indices are exposed to the same global shocks, the same crisis periods and the same macro cycles. At the beginning, I transformed the raw series into log returns, which enabled models to work on a scale that is easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline follows the following logic:\n",
    "First clean the data, then understand it, then try to predict it and finally evaluate how risky it truly is. Trend removal, scaling, stationarity checks and residual diagnostics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every preprocessing step is essentially a split that lowers entropy and makes the series more manageable. And the leftover randomness the part that remains after all splits, is “the entropy that remains after dividing by an attribute”, which is the component that the forecasting models attempt to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA is used for short-term dependence. Prophet is used to uncover smooth structural trends. EGARCH is used to model volatility, asymmetry and shock amplification. VaR backtesting reveals how the indices behave in the tail. Rolling correlations explain whether the link between IBEX and SPX is stable or keeps shifting over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "All models are applied symmetrically to avoid introducing bias in the comparison.\n"

    "## 3. Market Behaviour Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw dynamics already suggest that both markets live in different “rhythms”. The S&P500 tends to show long phases of calm movement, slow trend changes and relatively smooth recoveries after drawdowns. The IBEX, instead, moves in shorter bursts, with faster rotations, more abrupt reactions to political or sector-specific shocks, and a general tendency to cluster risk in shorter time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "When switching from prices to returns, this difference becomes clearer. The IBEX displays stronger volatility clustering and sharper jumps both upwards and downwards. The S&P500 still reacts strongly to global events, but its transitions between calm and volatile states happen more gradually. These differences set the stage for why ARIMA fits one index better than the other and why volatility models become so crucial for understanding the IBEX.\n"

    "## 4. Volatility and Drawdown Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility is the heart of the comparison. The EGARCH results show that both indices display asymmetric behaviour, but the degree is very different. The IBEX amplifies negative shocks far more aggressively, meaning that bad news immediately triggers increases in volatility that persist for several days. The S&P500, although asymmetric, reacts with much less intensity. Its volatility process is smoother, and the market absorbs negative information more gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawdowns reinforce the same pattern. The deepest IBEX drawdowns are more abrupt, steeper and usually appear concentrated around shorter time windows. The S&P500 tends to experience smoother declines that extend across longer horizons. This contrast matters because it shapes how forecasting models behave: when volatility jumps violently, both ARIMA and Prophet struggle more and residual noise increases. When volatility transitions are soft, the models adapt more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the volatility-drawdown block paints the same picture: the IBEX is more fragile, more shock-driven and more difficult to model. The S&P500 is more predictable because it behaves with more consistency.\n"

    "## 5. Forecasting Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### ARIMA and Prophet Performance\n",
    "ARIMA assumes that the remaining series is stationary, with a dependence pattern that can be captured by a combination of autoregressive and moving average terms. For an index like the S&P500, this tends to work reasonably well. Even though the SPX experiences volatility spikes and crisis periods, its behaviour over long stretches is smoother, and the autocorrelation structure of returns is more consistent. Once the series is transformed into returns and properly preprocessed, ARIMA can pick up the short-term dependence and produce forecasts with relatively low error. Residual diagnostics usually show fewer signs of remaining autocorrelation, and the model’s assumptions are closer to being satisfied. This is why ARIMA often achieves better accuracy on the SPX and produces residuals that look more like white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IBEX, on the other hand, is more problematic from the perspective of an ARIMA. Volatility clustering, sudden shocks and stronger asymmetries mean that the return dynamics are less stable. Even after differencing and cleaning, the IBEX may show episodes where the variance changes abruptly and the behaviour of the series shifts from one regime to another. In this environment, ARIMA does not fully fit, because it does not model conditional volatility explicitly. The result is a higher forecast error, residuals that still contain structure and, in many cases, underestimation of risk around turning points or stress periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet focuses on decomposing the series into trend, seasonality and holidays or events, and handles missing data and mild structural breaks in a very robust way. However, Prophet does not attempt to model conditional heteroskedasticity because it treats residual volatility more as noise than as a feature to be modelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means that Prophet can recover sensible trends for both indices and can cope with calendar-related effects or moderate structural changes. But when short-horizon forecasting is driven by volatility bursts, clustering and asymmetric reactions to shocks, Prophet has a clear disadvantage. It is less sensitive to changes in the risk environment and more focused on the average path of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting both together, a common pattern emerges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the S&P500, ARIMA often delivers better short-term forecasts because the residual structure is more stable and the volatility is easier to handle with a simple model. Prophet can still be useful for long-term level projections, but it does not usually outperform ARIMA on purely short-horizon return forecasts.\n",
    "- On the IBEX, both models struggle more, but for different reasons. ARIMA fails to capture all the volatility dynamics, and Prophet largely ignores them. The EGARCH component of the project becomes crucial here because it specifically targets the conditional variance, something that neither ARIMA nor Prophet can fully control on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up, by using ARIMA and Prophet together and comparing how each one reacts to the same data, they provide complementary views: ARIMA focuses on short-term autocorrelation in returns, Prophet on smooth trends and structure, and EGARCH on volatility."

    "## 6. Risk Diagnostics and VaR Backtesting\n",
    "\n",
    "The Value-at-Risk backtesting results provide a view of how each index behaves when markets move into their most extreme and least frequent scenarios. VaR is used to estimate the loss level that should only be exceeded a small percentage of the time, so backtesting focuses on counting how often the real losses fall outside the model’s prediction. Those exceedances reveal whether the model is underestimating the true risk of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher number of exceptions in the IBEX suggests that its return distribution has heavier left tails than what the model anticipates. In practical terms, the IBEX experiences sudden and deeper drops that the VaR model fails to capture, signalling that negative shocks are more abrupt and more likely to generate outsized losses. This is consistent with the stronger leverage effect seen in the EGARCH results, where bad news amplifies volatility disproportionately. When volatility reacts so aggressively to negative events, simple VaR models tend to misjudge the magnitude of extreme outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The S&P500, showing fewer exceptions and a more regular pattern of exceedances, behaves differently. Its tails are smoother, meaning that losses beyond the VaR threshold occur in a more predictable and evenly spaced way. This usually indicates that the market’s downside movements are less abrupt and that the risk model has an easier time fitting the actual behaviour of the data. It also suggests that the SPX’s volatility process is more stable, so the VaR model does not get “surprised” as often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the backtesting highlights a key contrast:  \n",
    "the IBEX tends to produce unexpected, sharper downside events, while the S&P500 displays a calmer and more model-friendly tail behaviour. This difference matters for any investor or risk manager, because it means the IBEX requires more conservative risk measures or more sophisticated modelling to avoid underestimating its true exposure in turbulent periods.\n"

    "## 7. Rolling Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling correlations help answer a simple question whether the IBEX and the S&P500 move together all the time, or only sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that the correlation is time-varying. During global crises, both indices move almost in lockstep, with correlations rising sharply. In calmer periods, however, the relationship weakens and sometimes drifts to much lower levels. This instability reflects the fact that the IBEX has a large domestic component that reacts to local events, while the S&P500 is driven by global macro conditions and sector-wide dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For modelling purposes, this matters because it means that the dependence between the two series is not constant. Any multivariate model would need to capture those time shifts explicitly. It also shows why the univariate approach adopted in this project is appropriate as a first step: before modelling joint dynamics, it is essential to understand each index independently and diagnose how much structure there is to extract.\n"

    "- Exploring higher–order EGARCH models (EGARCH(p,q)) instead of the baseline EGARCH(1,1).\n",
    "The current specification captures asymmetry and volatility clustering, but richer structures (e.g., EGARCH(2,1), EGARCH(1,2), EGARCH(2,2)) may better accommodate long-memory effects, layered volatility reactions, or multi-scale shock dynamics.\n",
    "Evaluating whether higher–order terms reduce forecast error or produce more stable conditional variance estimates would strengthen the credibility of the volatility model.\n",
    "- Extending to multivariate GARCH models, particularly DCC-GARCH or BEKK, to capture dynamic correlations and spillovers between IBEX and SPX.\n",
    "This would provide a more realistic picture of joint market-risk behaviour.\n",
    "- Implementing Markov-Switching models to detect and model regime changes in both mean and volatility.\n",
    "These can identify crisis episodes, volatility bursts, or structural transitions that linear models miss.\n",
    "- Incorporating macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, inflation, VIX, credit spreads or PMI, allowing conditional forecasts driven by economic states.\n",
    "- Applying modern machine-learning sequence models, including LSTM, DeepAR, N-BEATS or Transformer-based architectures, to test whether nonlinear dependence structures improve short-horizon forecasts.\n",
    "- Using forecast distributions for portfolio optimisation, integrating the predictive variance into risk-aware allocation strategies."

    "## 10. Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The S&P500 shows a clearer and more stable structure than the IBEX-35, with lower volatility and smoother responses to shocks. Its smaller EGARCH leverage effect suggests that negative events distort its volatility less, and its forecasting errors are consistently smaller. However, it is important to stress that this does not mean the SP500 is highly predictable only that, relative to the IBEX, it behaves in a more orderly way and leaves less unexplained noise for the models to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IBEX, on the other hand, reacts more sharply to negative shocks and experiences deeper drawdowns, which points to a more fragile and harder-to-model risk profile. Its volatility structure is richer and full of nonlinearities, making it more challenging but also potentially more rewarding in terms of volatility-driven strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the SPX emerges as the more tractable index, the forecasting results also show that there is still plenty of room for improvement. The predictability we observed is only partial, and the models used here capture only a fraction of its underlying dynamics. For future work, it would be especially interesting to model the SP500 in greater depth, since it is the index that displayed the strongest and most consistent signals of predictability. Exploring higher-order EGARCH models, multivariate structures, or more advanced forecasting techniques could help uncover whether this relative stability translates into more robust forecasting performance when examined with more refined tools.\n"
